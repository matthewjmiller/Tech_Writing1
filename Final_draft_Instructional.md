## Introduction

Despite what Hollywood portrays, jumping on a horse and chasing Indians as you fire a gun over the horses head is not how riding horses work. Riding a horse is a process that is more than jumping on a horse and galloping away. Horse riding involves several different aspects that include catching the horse, cleaning the horse, saddling the horse, bridling the horse, and then finally getting on the horse and riding it. Properly following the sequence of events will keep the person riding the horse safe as well as keep the horse safe. Horses can be skittish, so it is always important that safety is kept in mind while handling a horse. You should always let the horse know you are close to it by talking to it. Do not walk right behind a horse, they kick very well and a solid kick could kill you. Be calm around the horse and the horse will stay calm.

{>> MM: I get that safety is important, but I wonder if these specific tips above would have fit better somewhere else, or would have benefitted from being set off from the text in some way for emphasis. <<}

*This instructional is designed for people who are new to riding horses.* This will be a step by step instruction. It is important to follow these steps to avoid injury to either you or the horse. You will have the best success in riding a horse by following this step by step instruction.

### Tools Needed

These are tools and supplies needed to get a horse ready to ride and to actually ride the horse. Some of this gear has many parts to it, but that gets advanced quickly so I will avoid mentioning them too much. {>> MM: OK, but if I want more info on that, where can I go? It's fair to say something is out of your scope, but if you feel a need to mention it at all, maybe direct your reader where to go for more. <<}

- Brush
- Halter

## Step by Step Instructions

{>> MM: as above, I think the title here could be more specific or creative for better impact. <<}

### Step 1. Catching the Horse

Catching the horse you are going to ride can be somewhat difficult depending on the horse's attitude and personality. Having a bucket of grain is always helpful in attracting the horse close enough to catch. Once the horse comes close enough wrap the lead rope around the horses neck to give it the illusion it is caught, then put the halter on the horse's head, and reattach the lead rope to the base of the halter. Lead the horse to where you will saddle it and tie the lead rope to something solid.

### Step 2. Cleaning the Horse

Horses like to roll around in the dirt, so they must be cleaned a little bit before saddling them. Take a currycomb and scrape off all the caked on dirt and mud. When combing the horse's coat be sure to start from the neck and work your way back and down. Combing with the lay of the hair is important to prevent damage to the horse's coat. Once you are done with combing, take a brush and repeat the process starting from the neck and working back and down. The brush is mainly for working the dust out of the coat.

### Step 3. Saddling the Horse

Properly attaching the saddle to the horse is the most important part of preparing to ride. A saddle incorrectly attached to a horse can move and slide around the horse's body and cause harm to both you and the horse. When saddling a horse, work from the left side of the horse. First, place the saddle blanket on the horse's back with the front edge on the withers. Then, place the saddle on the back of the horse making sure the pommel of the saddle sits on top of the horses withers (shoulders). Reach under the horse and grab the front cinch, pulling the cinch back to the left side where you attach it to the front rigging dee on the left side. Make sure that the front cinch is positioned right behind the front legs. The front cinch should tight enough to keep the saddle from sliding around. Next, you pull the flank cinch across the underside of the horse and attach it to the buckle on the left side. The flank cinch does not need to be tight. The purpose of the flank cinch is to just keep the saddle from going over the horses head if there is a sudden stop. Now take the breast collar around the base of the neck at the breast of the horse and attach it to the front rigging dee. Then take the connection strap attached to the breast collar and attach it to the front cinch between the front legs. Go back through all the straps and checks the tightness of each from beginning to end to make sure everything is correctly set up.

### Step 4. Bridling the Horse

The different parts of the bridle are as follows: bit, chinstrap, browband, headpiece, noseband, and cheek straps. Getting the bridle on the horses head can be one of the more difficult steps in this process due to the bit going in their mouth. Hold the bit in your left hand and the headpiece in your right hand in the position that it would sit on their head. Ease the bit into their mouth until it is behind their teeth. If they won't open their mouth you can squeeze their gums at the back of their bottom jaw to force them to open their mouth. As you put the bit in, slide the chinstrap into position underneath the chin. After the bit is in place, pull the headpiece over the horses head past the ears. When pulling the headpiece past the ears be careful with the ears by folding them forward flush against the horses head. Then buckle the throatlatch where the neck meets the head of the horse. Make sure to buckle with tight but not tight enough to choke the horse. Now check the browband to make sure it is in the proper position between the eyes and the ears. If the reins are not already attached to the bridle, then attach the reins to the loops at the ends of the bit where the cheek straps and chinstrap come together.

### Step 5. Mounting the Horse

First, you want to pull the reins over the horses head and lay them on its neck. Then untie the lead rope from whatever it was tied to. Either detach the lead rope from the halter or tie it to the front rigging dee on the saddle. There is a general rule of thumb of mounting a horse from the left side, and it is correct. Stick your left foot in the left side stirrup, then grab the saddle horn, simultanoeusly push off your left foot and swing your right leg over the back of the horse. Once in the saddle make sure both feet are in the stirrups and you have the reins in your hand.

### Step 6. Controlling the Horse's Movement and Velocity

The reins should be held in your dominant hand. To steer the horse in the direction you desire to go simply pulls the reins in that direction. In other words, to go left, pull left and to go right pull right. the horse will start moving forward if you tap them with your heels and give them some sort of audible signal. Stopping the horse can be done by pulling straight back on the reins and saying "whoa". When the horse does what you want it to do, pat and give it some words of encouragement.

## FAQs

- Q: How do I stop the horse?
- A: *Pull back on the reins and say "whoa" sternly and audible to the horse.*
- Q: How do I get the horse to move?
- A: *Gently kick or tap the horse with both feet and click your mouth while simultaneously relaxing the reins.*
- Q: How fast should I go?
- A: *Only as fast as you are comfortable with, I suggest sticking to a walk until you are comfortable with going faster.*
- Q: How do I get off the horse?
- A: *Reverse of how you got on. Swing your right leg over the horses back and ease yourself down while holding the saddle horn.*

## Pitfalls

- Avoid getting on the horse in rough terrain, use a soft grassy area. *Trust me I know from experience.* {>> MM: haha, I bet you do. <<}
- Avoid holding onto the horn of the saddle with the reins in your hand, it prevents you from controlling the horse.
- Double check your saddle before getting on as it can loosen after the horse has been saddled.
- Let your horse drink water at opportunities like water crossings or water tanks. {>> MM: how is this a pitfall? <<}
